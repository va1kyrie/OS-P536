1: An orphan process is a process whose parent has finished or otherwise terminated, though the 
   child (now orphan) is still running. A zombie process is a process that has finished or 
   terminated but still has an entry in the process table.

   In other words, an orphan process' parent has died, and a zombie process is dead, but may not 
   fully realize it yet.

2: When a child process calls exec(), the address space of the child process is replaced with the 
   command provided to exec(). While the PID of the child process remains the same, the
   instructions within the process are essentially overwritten with the instructions for the 
   command specified in the call to exec(). For instance, if exec() was used to call ls, the
   instructions the child inherited from its parent process are replaced with the instructions
   for ls, and ls is executed. When ls (or whatever command called) is finished, the child process
   terminates.
